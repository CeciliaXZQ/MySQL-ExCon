# ExCon

## Establishes a one-way link between the Outlook Calendar and Confluence Team Calendar using Exchange Webservices

Installing this plug-in allows you to sync events from your Outlook Calendar to your Confluence Team Calendar that are marked as **all-day** events. This is useful for vacation planning. The plug-in can sync all events from today to 2 years into the future to make vacation planning easier.
It requires the admin of your Confluence Server to set up the plugin once and then for every sync you must enter your Outlook Credentials in the plug-in splash screen. Please refer to our User Manual and Getting Started guides under the wiki-tab on GitHub.
